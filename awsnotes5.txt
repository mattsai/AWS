Logging services:
CloudTrail: logs all API calls, between aws services : who can blame who created this bucket, who spin up that expensive ec2 instance
who launched this sagemaker notebook, detect developer misconfiguration, malicious actors.

cloudwatch: collection of multiple services : logs, metrics: represent a time oreded set of data points. events (eventbridge): trigger an event based on a condition.
alarms: triggers notifications based on metrics, dashboard: create visualizations based on metrics

Cloud watch alarm: 
moniors a cloudwatch metric based on a defined threshold , when alarm breaches goes poutside the defined tthreshhold than it hcanges state
Alarm states: ok: metric expression is within the defined threshhold, alarm : metric or rexpression is outside of the defined threshold, insufficient data: alarm has just started, metric is not available, not enough data 	 
when changing state we can define action it should trigger, SNS, create a topic etc.
metric: time oreded set of data points its a variable that is motniroed over time.
comes with predefiend metrics.
ec2 per instance mtrics: cpu utilization diskreadips, diskwriteops, networkin networkout. diswrite brytes, readbytes
	 


CloudTrail: used to monitor api calls and actions made on a aws acc.
4w : where, when, who , what (region, resource, action).
will collect logs or last 90 days via event history.
if ypou need more than 90 days you need to create a trail. trails are output to s3 and do not have  agui like event history so for you to analyze a trail you would have to use amazon athena 	
Threshold condition:defines when datapoints is breached
Metric: the actual data that we are measuring 
Period: how often it checks to evaluate the alarm
datapoints to alarm: 1 data points is breached ina evaluation period going back 4 period 
datapoints:represents the metric's measurement at a given point

Log events:
Log streams: sequence of events from application or instance being monitored 	 
you CAN create log streams manually but generally this is automatically doen by the service you are using
Lambda: logs streams named after the running instance
ec2: named after the running instnace's instance id
aws gue: named after glue jobs
Log insights: interactively serach and analyze your cloudwach log data and has the folloding advantages.
more robust filtering, then using the simple filter events in a log stream.
supports al types of logs.
is commonly used via the console to do ad hoc queries against logs groups.
has is own language called- cloud watch log insights query syntax: a single request cna query up to 20 log groiuos.
if the query pass 15 monutes, they are time out
query result are available for 7 days

aws well architedted framework:
white paper created by aws to help customer build using best practices defined by aws.

framework is divided into 5 sections: called pillars which address different aspect or lenses
5 pillars: operational excellence security, reliability performance efficiency, cost optimization

general definitions:
operational excellent pillar: run and monitor systems
security pillar: protect data and systems, mitigate risk
reliability pillar: mitigate and recover from disruptions
performance efficiency pillar - use comuting resources effecively
cost optimization pillar- get the lowest price

component- code configutaion and aws resource 
workload - set of components that work togheter to deliver business value
molestones - key changes of your architecture thorugh product life cycle
architecture - how components work together in a workload
technology portfolio -collection of workloads required for the business to operate

amazon leadership principles:
set of principles userd during compny decision-making, problem solving, simple brainstorming and hiring.
customer obsesion, ownership,invent and simplify, are right a lot, learn and be curious, hire and develop the best, think big,bias for action, deliver results, scuess and scale

general design principles:
stop guessing your capacities needs : cloud computing you use as little or much basedon demand
test systems at production scale: clone prod env to testing tear down testing not in use to save money
automate to make architectural experimentation easier: using cloud formation with change sets, stackupdate and drift detection
evolutionary architectures : eg ci/cd rapid or nighly releasys or if u use serlverless : lambdas forcing you to evolve 
architectures using data: cloudwatch, cloudtrail
improve through game days, simulate traffic on production or purposely kill ec2 instance to see test recovery

anatomy of a pillar:
design principles: list of design principles that need to be considered during implementation
definition: overview of the best practices caterogies
best practices: detail information about each best practice with aws service
resorces: additional doc, whitepapers and vidoes to implement this pillar

operational exellence:
Perform operations as code: apply same engineering discipline you would to application code to your cloud infrastructure
infrastucture as code

make frequent small resversible changes: design workloads to allow components to be updated regularly
eg;: rollbacks, incremental changes blue/gree, ci/cd

refine opretiaons procedures frequently : look for continuos opportunities to improve your operations
eg: use game gays to simulate traffic or event failure on your production workloads 

anticipate failure: perform post mortems on system failures to better improve, write test code, kil prod srvers to test recovery

learn from all operation failures: share lessons learnig in a kowledge base for operational events and failures across your entire organization

Securiry:
implement strong identity foundation: implement principle of least privilege PoLP. 
enable traceability: monitor alert and audit actions and changes to your environment in real time 
apply security at all layers. take defense in depth approach with multiple security controls for everything eg: edge network vpc, load balancing instances, os app code
automate security best practices
protect data in transit and at rest
keep people away from data
preparre for security events: incident mangamenet systems, investigate and recover rom incidenses

reliability
automatically recover from failure: monitor key performance indicatos, trigger automation when threshold is breache d
test recover procedures: test how your wokloads fails and you validate your revoery procedures
scale horizontallyto to ingcrease aggretate system availability: replace one large resource with multiple small resurces to reduce the impact of an single failure on the overall workload
stop guessing capacity: request the reight size of resources on demand
manage change in atuomation: IaC allow formal process to track and review infrastructure

	 

Perofrmance efficiency:
Democratize advanced techonlogies: focus on product development rather than procurement
go global in minutes: deploying workload in mltiple aws regions around hte wolrlds allows yo provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost 
use serverless architectures: serverless architectures remove the need for you to run and maintain physical servers for traditional compute activies
experiment more often: with virtual and automatable resources you can quickly carry out compartive testing 
consider mechanical sypathy understand how cloud services are consued and always use the tehhnology approach that aligns best with your workload


Cost optimization:
implement cloud financial management: dedicate time and resources to build capability cloud financial management and cost optimization
adopt a consumption model: pay only for the computing resources that you require and icnrease or decrease usage depending on business
measure overall efficiency:	increasing output and reducing cost
stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting: aws does the heavy lifting data center ops like racking, stacking and powering servers
analyze and attribute expenditure: identigy and cost of systems which then allows transparent attribution of it costs to individual workload owners 


aws well architected tool: auditing tool to be used to asset your cloud workloads for alignment with aws well architected
it's essentially a checklist to help you assembly a report to share with executives and key stake holders 

AWS Architecture center: web portal contains best practices and reference architectures for variety of different workloads 

TCO: total cost ownership
financial estimte intendeted to help buyess and owners to determine the direct and indirect costs of a product service:
hardwware, monitoring,, it personnel, taxes, licensing, security software etc

creeating tco is useufl when: your cmpany is looking to migrato from on premise to cloud 

capex: On premise: software license fees,  implementation traning, phyisical security, it personal, maintance
opex : aws: subcription fees , implementation configuration training  
75% savings  o:

capex vs opex :
capital expenditure: spending money upfront on physical infrastructure 
server, storage, network, backup, disaster, datacenter, technical personal, you hae to guess upfront what you plan to spend

operational expenditure :
cost the customer only has to concerned with no physical costs : leading software , traning employees in clouds erices, paying for cloud support, billing based on cloud emtircs, compute, storage etc.
operation expenses you can try a product or service without investing in eequipment

shifting it personnel:
a company is considering migrating their workloads from on premise o the cloud to take advange of the savings, there is a concern : "Doues cloud make it personnel redundant"
sfhiting your IT team: company needs it personnel during the migration phase
company can transition some roles to new cloud roles : networking to cloud networking 
company may decide to take a hybrid approach so thell alway eed to have a traditonal it team 
company can change emplyees activies from managing infrastructure to revenue generating 

aws pricing calculator: free cost estimate tool that can be used within your web browser without the eed for an aws acc to estimate the cost of various aws services 
you cann export your final estimate to a csv


migration evaluator: formally known as tso logic, is an estimate tool used to determine an organization existing on premise cost so it can compare it agains aws costs for planned cloud migration
uses agentless collector to collect data form your on premise infrastructureto extract your on premise costs

VM import/export: import virutal machine into ec2, aws has import instructions for vmware, citrix, microsoft hyperv, etc
1.- prepare your virtual image for upload, upload your virtual image to s3, use aws cli to import your image it will genrate an ami amazon machine iamge

aws abuse: aws trust & safety is a team that specifically deals with abuses ocurring on the aws platform for the following issues:
spam: you are receving unwanted emails from an aws owned ip address 
port scanning: logs show that one or more aws owned op address are sending packet to multiple ports on your server, thisis an attempt to discover unsecured ports 
dos attacks: your logs shows that one or more aws owned ip addresses are used to flood porst on your resources with packets, you also believe that this is an attempt to overwhelm or crash your server or the software runnung on your server
intrussion attempts: more aws owned ip addresses are used to attempt to log in in to your resources
hosting prohibited content: evidence that aws resources are used to host or distribute prohibited content such as ilegal content or copyrighted content
distributing malware: ypu have evidence that aws resoruces are used to distribute software that was knowingly created to compromise or cause harm to computers or machines that it's installed on

for these cases you DO NOT open a aws support, you need to create an abuse ticket or fill out the report amazon aws abiuse form

aws credits generally have an expirity date attached to them
can be used for mroe services but are exceptions eg: purchasing a domain via route53 (that domaincost outside aws costs for their infra )


aws parnet network:is a global partner program for aws, joining the amazon parnet network apn, will open your organization up to business opportunities and allwos exclusive trainings and marketing events
you can be: consulting partner (help companies utilize aws) or techonlogy partner(you build technology ontop of aws as a seervice offering)

a partner belongs to a specific tier: select advanced or premier
different tiers have diff annual fee commitments 
diff tiers have diff knowledge requirements: aws certification , aws apn exclusive certification

aws budgets: aws budgets: give you the ability to setup alet is you exceed or areapproaching your defined budget
create cost usage and reverstaion budgets
can eb tracket monthly quearterly or yearly levels 
support ec2,rds,redshhift and elsasticcache reservations
aws budgets can userd to forecase scosts but is limited compared to cost explorer or doing your analysis with aws costand usage reports along wiht business intelligence tool	 
can eb easily amaned from the aws budgets dahsboar or via budgets api get notified by providing an email or chatbot and treshhold how close to the current or forecased budget 


aws budget reports: used alongside aws budgets to ccreate and send daily,weekly monthly reports to monitor the performance of your aws budget, 

aws cost and usage reports:
Cost and usage reports: generate a detailed spreadsheet enabling you to better analyze and understand your aws costs 
places the reports into s3,use athena to turn the report into a queryable databsae
use quicksight to visualize oyur billing data as graphs 
you can choose data by selecting hourly, daily, monthly, 
the report wil contain cost allocation tags
CUR cost and usage reports is stored in a csv gzip or parquet format in yur selected s3 bucket 

Cost allocation task: are optional metadata that can be attached to aws resoruces so when you generate out a csot and usage report you can use that data to better analyze your data
twto types of tags: user defined, aws generated

billing alarms: can create your own alarms in cloud watch alarms t monitor spend, they are commonly called billign alarms
for use them you need to turn on biling alerts. create a cloudwatch alarm and choose billing as your emtric 
billing alarms aremuch more flexible than aws budgets, and ideal for more complex use case for monitoring spend and usage

aws cost explorer: visuzlize understand and manage yotu aws cost over time 
you can use forecasting to get an idea of future costs , can choose daily or monthly level of granularity you have lot of filter control 
cost explorer shows up in us east-1

bat api - price list api via html
	
you can also ssubcrite bo amazon simple notifcation srvice notification to get alerts when prices for the services change
aws prices change periodically such as when aws cuts prices 


defense in depth
7 layrs of security:
1 data: access t business and customer data and enceyption to protect data
2 application : apps are secured anf ree of security vulnerabilities
3 compute: access to virtual machines ports, on premise, cloud
4 network: limit communication between resources using segmentation and acess control
5 perimeter: distributed denial of service ddos protection to filter alrge scale attacs before they cna cause a denial of service for user
6 identity and access: controlling access to infrastructure and change control
7 physical: limiting access to datancer to only authorized personnel

ZTM zero trust model 

CIA Triad: confidentiality, integrity and availabilty CIA triad is amodel describinf the foudnation to security principles and theeir tradeoff relationship
confidentiality: protect our data fro unathorized viewers, in practice: cryptographic keys to encript our data using keys to encrypt our keys, envelope encryption
integrity: accuracy and completeness of dataa over its entire lifecycle practice: utilizing acid compliant daabase for valid transation atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability
availability information ened to be made be available when eneded in practice: high availability, migratind ddos, decryption access
the cia triad was first mentioned in a nist publication from 1977	

vulnerability: hole or weakness in the application that can be design flaw or an imp bug ; OWASP
buffer overfloe, improper data validation, least privilege violatin, memory leak 

encryption: cryptography: practice and study of techniques for secure comunication in the presence of third parties called 
encryption: process of encoding(scrabbling) informatin using a key and  acypher to store sensitive data in an unintelligible format 
encryption akes in plaintext and produces ciphertext 
cyphers: algorithm to perform encryption or decryption.
ciphertext: ciphertext is the result of encryption performed on plaintext via na algorithm
cryptographic key: key is avariable used in conjunction with an encryption algorithm in order to encrypt or decrypt data
symmetric encryption: the same key is used for encoding and decoding eg: advance encryption standard AES	 
asymetric encryption, one key to encode and another to decode eg: rivest-shamir-adleman RSA
hashing and salting: 
hashing function. accepts arbitrary size value and maps it to a fixed size data structure, hashing can reduce the size of the store value
hashing is one way process and deterministic :  returns the same output for the same input
popular hashing : md5, sha256 and bcrypt 
salting: random string not known to the attacker that the hash function accepts to mitigate the deterministac nature of hashing function
