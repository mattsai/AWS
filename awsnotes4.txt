Digital signatures and signing:
mathematical scheme fr verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents 
a digital signature give us tamper evidence
dis someone mess(modify) the data, is this data not from the expected sender
3 algorithms for digital signatures. 
key generation :  generates a public and private key
signing : the process of generating a digital signature with a private key and inputted message
signing verification: verify the authencity of the message with  apublic key
SSH uses a public and private key to authorize remore aces intoa remote machine eg VM its common to use RSA
ssk-keygen is well known command to generate public and private key
ssh-keygen -t rsa 

in tansir vs at rest encryption:
data is secure when moving between locations algorithms: tls, ssl
encryotion at rest: data is secure when residing on storage or within a database :algorithms aws, rsa
TLS: transport layer security
encryption protocol for daata integrity between two or more communicating computer applications tls 1.2 and 1.3 is the current best practice

SSL:: secure socket layers
encryton protocol for data integrity between two or more communication compute rapplication 
1,2,3 deprecated :

Hardware security module: piece of hardware designed to store encryption keys hold keys in memory and never write them to disk
follows FIPS federal informatio processing standard : 
HMS that are multi tenant are FIPS 104-2 level 2 compliant multiple customers virtually isolated on a hsm  : AWS KMS
HSM that are single tenant fips 140-level3 compliant single customer ona  a dedicatd HSM :  AWS Cloud HSM

AWS KMS: key management service: makes it easy for you to create ad control encyption keys ysed to encrypt your data 
multi tenant HSM manyw aws are integrated to use kms to encrypt your data with simple checkbox 
Envole encryption:
encrypt data your data is protected but you have to protectyout encryption key
when u encrypt your data key with a master key as an additional layer of security 
(i have my data i use this key -> so i need to protect this key so i use another key to encrypt this key and store that master key into kms  key managent service)
Cloud HSM: single tenant hsm as aservice  that automates hardware privisioning software patching  high availabilty and backup
enables generate and use your encryption keys on FIPS 140-4 level 3 
can transfer keys to otehr commercial hsm solutions to make it easy to migrate keys on or off aws 
configure aws kms to use aws cloudhsm cluster as customer key

aws config vs aws appconfig
aws config: governance tol for compliance as code CoC
can create rules that will check to see fi resources are configured the way you expect them to be
if a resources drifts from the expected configuration you are notified or aws config can auto remediate -correct- the configuration

AWS Appconfig: autoamte process of deplying applications configuration ->variables<- changes to your webapps
you can write a validator to ensure the changed variable will not break your web app

SNS vs SQS: botj connect apps via meesages
SNS:
pass alongs messages eg: pubsub
send notifications to subscribers of topics via protocol : http,email,sqs,sms
is generally used for sending plain text emails is triggered via othe aws services, the betst example of this is billing alarms
can retry sending in case of failure for https, good for webooks, simple itnernal emails, triggering lambda functions
 
SQS:
queue up messages, guaranteed delivery
places messages into a queue apps  pull queue using aws sdk 
can retaina message for up to 14 daysm sen them in sequential or in paralell
really good for delayed tasksk queueing up emails, tabbitmq

SNS vs SQS vs PinPoint vs Workmail:
they all send emails

SNS: notification to subscribers of topics
SES: transactional email - emails that should be triggered based on in-app actions: signup, reset password, invoice , sends html emails sns cannot
PinPoint: Promotional emails emails for marketing . email campaings, segment your contacs 
Workmail: email web client similat go gmail and outlook create company emails, read, write adn send emails from a web client within aws management console 

Amazon Inspector vs AWS Trusted advisor: both are scurity tools and the both perform audits
Inspector:
audits a single EC2 isntance that you have selected, generates report from long list of security checks i.e: 699 checks
Trusted advisor: doesn't generate out a pdf report
gives a holistic view of recommecntions across multiple service and best practices, eg: you have open ports on these security groups
-you should enable mfa on your root acc-

Connect named services:
Direct Connect: dedicated fiber optics connection from your datacenter to aws , intender for large enterprises, if you need secure connection you need to apply aws vpn connection on top fo direct connect
Amazon connect: call center as aservice, get a tol free number
Media connect: new version of elastic transcoders convers videos to different video types

elastic transcoder vs media convert: both services transcodes videos
elastic transcoder : old way: transcodes videos to straming formarts
aws elemantal mediaconvert: the new way :  more robust transcoding service that can peform various operations during transcoding 
overlays images, insert video clibs , robus ui 

Amazon artifact vs amazon inspector: both compile out PDFs
artifact: why an enterprise trust aws,, generates securirt report based on global compliance frameworks as: SOC service organizationcontrol, PCI, Payment card industry
inspector: how do we know this EC2 instance is secure-prove it runs a script that analyzes you ec2 instnace then generates a pdf report telling you which security checks passed

ELB Variants: 
ELB: MAIN SERVICE has 4 different types of possible load balancer ALB
ALB : layer 7 https, routing rules, create rules to change routing based on information foudn ina http/s request , can attack AWS WAF 
NLB: LAYER 3,4 TCP AND UP extreme performance required for TCP and TLS traffic, capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaning ultra low latencies, sudden and volatile traffic patterns while using static ip addres per AZ
GWLB : when you need to deploy fleet of third party vitual appliancs support GENEVE 
CLB: layer 3,4,7 intended for apps that wew built within the ec2 classic network does not use target groups 	retires on aug 15 2022
