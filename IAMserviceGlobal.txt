create users -> IAM 


You can create groups [user1,user2,user3]
Group:
	G1: A1,A2,A3
	G2: B1,B2
	G3: A1,B1
User: x //no group :<

Groups only contain users,not other groups

Permissions = policies [json]
IAM Policy 

Policies =  define permissions of the users

Least Privilege Principle = don't give more permissions than a user needs


IAM Service: [Global]
Security: create a administrator users
and don't use the root user unless something happen

Account management: 
->Users 
->Add users

YOu'll need to create an alias in order
to acces as an IAM user
and will ask you to change the password :o
