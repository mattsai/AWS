*Other database services:
Redshift : petabyte size- data warehouse online analytical procesing, OLAP, expensive keepind gata how, complex query = get that data back very fast
when you to quicly generate analytics or reports from a large amount of data.

ElasticCache is managed database of the in-memory and caching 
redis or memcached. : when you need to improve the performance of application by adding or caching layer 

Neptune: managed graph database. data is represented as interconnected nodes.
When you need to understand the connections between data eg. mapping, social media relationships.

Amazon timestreams: fully managed time series database. think of devices that send lots of data that are time sensitivite such as IoT devices: when you need to measure how things change over time

amazon quantum ledger database: ledger database that provides transparent, immutable and cryptographically variable transacion LOGS.
when you need to record history or financial activities that can be trusted. every record is immutable o:

Database Migration Service DMS : is a database migration service. You can migrate from  on premise database to aws. from two database in different or same aws account using different sql engines. from an sql to nosql

Networking services:
Region : gregraphical location of your network 
VPC : logically isolated section of the aws cloud where yo can launch aws services
az: data center of your aws resources
subnets: logical partition of an ip network into multiple, smaller network segments
route tables: determine where network traffic from your subnets are directed
internet gateway: enable acces to the internet
nacls: acs a firewalls at the subnet level
security groups: act as a firewall athte instance level

hybrid networking services:
aws virtual private network: consecure connection bewteen on premise, remote offices, mobile employeees
direct connect : dedicated gigabi connection from n premise data center to aws very fast connections´
PrivateLinks: vpc interface endpoints: keeps traffic within the aws network and no traverse the internet; traffis is secure.

Virtual private cloud & subnets: }
vpc. logically isolated section of aws network where you can launch your aws resources you chose a range of IPs using CIDR range
CIDR Range of 10.0.0.0/116 = 65536 ip addresses
subnets: logical partitions of an ip network intomultiple network segments, youre breaking your ip range for a vpc
subnetd need to have a smaaller cidr range than to the vpc 	
public subnet : can reach internet
private subnet: cannot reach internet 

Security groups vs NACLs:
NACL netowrk acess control list: firewall at the subnet level (can allow and deny rules, blocka  specific ip address )
security groups: IMPLICITY denies all traffic. firewall a tthe instance level: you create only allow rules
you only ALLOW, allow an ec2 instance acccess on port 22 for ssh 

EC2: highly configurable virtual server VM
is resizable compute capcaity it takes minutes to launch new instances
anything and everything on aws uses ec2 instnace underneath
EC2 Instance families: combinations of cpu memory storage and network capacity 

EC2 Instance types: instance size and instance family
ec2 instances sizes generally double in price and key attributes, dobule next double price and sometimes dobule cVPU and ram

Dedicated host vs dedicated isntances.
Dedicated host: single tenant ec2 instanes deisgnet to ley tou bring your own license based on machines characteristics )
 En resumen, dedicated instances se ejecutan en hardware dedicado, mientras que dedicated hosts son servidores físicos dedicados.
dedicated hosts: you have visibility of phyisical characteristics : sockets, cores host ID

EC2 Tenancy: 
Dedicaded hosts : your server lives here and you have control of the phyisical attributes whol server
dedicated instnace : slot or part of the server conviving with other but your dedicated will be the same
default. you instance lives there until reboot it will be in other place	

Elastic IP Addres: asocia una IP Estatica a un recurso porque cuado tu reinicias o termiasn y inciias un servicio obtiene una ip diferente alabestai carnal


EC2 Pricing Models: 
1.- On demans: least commitment : low cost and flexib,e, pay per hour or p second, cannot be interrupteb first time apps
2.- stop : up to 90% request spare computing capacity flexible start and end times : biggest savings
3.- reserved up to 75% steady state or predictable usage, commit to EC2 over 1 or 3 year 
4.- Dedicated: : most expensive, dedicated servers, can be on demand or reserved or spot
savings plans: save but can be user for more than just ec2 

On demand: when laucnhign ec2 by default on demand: pay as you go payg , workload = short-tem, spikey, unpredictable
hourly rate 
Reserver Instances RI: term : longer term the greater the savings
class: standard 75% reduced you can modify RI attribues ;;  convertible ;; up to 54% reduced pricing compared to on demand, you can exchange ri based on ri attributes
payment: all up front,, partial upfront, no upfront (you are billed a dsicounted hourly rate )
RI Attributes: 4ri attributes
1.- instance type: example m4 large, t2 micro etc 
2.- region: region  reserved is purchased
3.- tenancy : multi tenand -shared- or singel tenand --dedicated-
4.-platform te os windows/linux ec

you can purchase for Region or Availability Zone:
regional: doesn't reserve capcity ; discount -any - az in the region ; ri discount to instance usage ;  can qeuue pirchases
zonal: reserves capacity; discount to selected az no flexibility; no instance size flexibility; instance usage for the specified instance only 

YOu can only purchase 20 RI per region and 20 per AZ

capacity reservations: theres is finite amount of server available lets say yo want to launch an specific ecc2 instnace but aws has run out of that server
so Capacity Reservation : is  aserviec of EC2 that allows you to request a reserve of ec2 instance type for a specific region and az
the reserved capacity is charged at the selected instance type's 
Ri marketpalce:  allows you to sell your unused standard RI 

Spot Instances: discount 90% , very low compute cost, AWS Batch is an easy anc vonenient way to use spot pricing
Instances can be terminated by aws anytime, if the comptuign capacity is eneded or on demand customers example xd
if tis terminated by aw you dont get charged for a partial hour of usage 
if ypu terminated it you still get charged for any hour that ir
